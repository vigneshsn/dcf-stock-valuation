    <h1>Value a Stock with Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        Learn how to estimate what a stock is truly worth not just what the market says.
        This simple step-by-step guide helps you value a company using future cash flow projections.

        <h2>Why Value a Stock?</h2>
        <p class="muted">
            Valuing a stock helps you make smarter investing decisions. Instead of blindly buying or selling
            based on the market price, you understand what the business is <em>actually worth</em>
            based on the cash it can generate in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Benjamin Graham, the legendary value investor and author of <strong>The Intelligent Investor</strong>,
            compared the stock market to a person named <strong>“Mr. Market.”</strong> Sometimes he’s excited
            and offers stocks at high prices, sometimes he’s fearful and sells them cheap.
            By doing your own valuation, you can decide whether Mr. Market’s price is a bargain or a trap.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
            💡 Example: If Mr. Market offers a stock at ₹100 but your valuation says it’s worth ₹150 —
            that’s a potential buying opportunity!

        <h2>What is Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)?</h2>
        <p>
            Think of a business as a <strong>machine that prints cash every year</strong>.
            Warren Buffett often calls this the business’s <strong>“owner earnings”</strong> —
            the real cash a company can generate for its owners after paying for all necessary
            expenses and maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</strong> model asks:
            “How much are all those future cash prints worth in today’s money?”
            Because a rupee today is worth more than a rupee in the future,
            we <strong>discount</strong> future cash to its present value.
        </p>
        <p>
            Add up these discounted future cash flows, include a <strong>terminal value</strong>
            for the years beyond your forecast, and you’ll get a reasonable estimate
            of what the company is worth today — its <strong>intrinsic value</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Owner Earnings</h2>
        <p class="muted">
            Owner earnings represent the <strong>real cash</strong> a company makes for its owners
            after paying all necessary expenses and maintaining its operations.
            Unlike accounting profits, it shows how much money is truly available for shareholders —
            to pay dividends, reduce debt, or reinvest for growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of this as the company’s “take-home pay” — what’s left after running the business
            and maintaining its assets.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Formula:</strong><br>
            Owner Earnings = Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization − Capital Expenditures

        <h2>How to Use This Calculator</h2>
        <p class="muted">
            Start by entering a few key financial figures — such as revenue, net profit, capital expenditure,
            and depreciation — which you can easily find on
            <a href="https://www.screener.in/" target="_blank">Screener.in</a>
            or in the company’s annual report.
            It’s best to take the <strong>3-year average</strong> to smooth out one-time spikes.
        </p>

<!--        <ol>-->
<!--            <li><strong>Estimate future revenue growth</strong> — based on past performance or your own assumptions.</li>-->
<!--            <li><strong>Enter profit margin %</strong> — how much profit is made per ₹100 of sales.</li>-->
<!--            <li><strong>Set a free cash flow %</strong> — the portion of profits that become actual cash.</li>-->
<!--            <li><strong>Apply a discount rate (expected return)</strong> — usually 10–15% for Indian equities.</li>-->
<!--            <li><strong>Add a terminal growth rate</strong> — long-term steady growth (e.g., 4–6%).</li>-->
<!--        </ol>-->

        <p>
            The calculator projects the company’s future <strong>owner earnings</strong>,
            discounts them to the present value, and adds the terminal value.
            The result is your estimate of <strong>intrinsic value</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, apply the <strong>Margin of Safety</strong> principle:
            buy only if the current market price is <strong>20–30% below</strong> your estimated value.
            This cushions you against forecast errors and market volatility.
        </p>
        <p>A 20% margin of safety is applied to the fair value for a conservative estimate.</p>
