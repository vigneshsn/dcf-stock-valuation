    <h1>Value a Stock with Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</h1>
    <p class="lead">A simple, step-by-step guide for stock valuation. By following this article you learn how to value a
        stock </p>

        <h2>Why value a stock?</h2>
        <p class="muted">Valuing a stock gives you a reasonable estimate of what the business is worth based on the cash
            it can generate in the future instead of blindly buying or selling based on the market price. Benjamin
            Graham author of book intelligent investor calls the stock market a person named "Mr. Market" sometimes he's
            euphoric and offers you bargains, sometimes he's panicked and overpriced. By valuing the company yourself,
            you decide whether Mr. Market's price is an opportunity or a warning.</p>

        <h2>Discounted Cash Flow</h2>

        <p>
            Think of a business as a machine that prints cash every year. Warren Buffett often calls this the business’s
            <strong>“owner earnings”</strong> — the real cash a company can generate for its owners after all the
            necessary
            expenses to maintain the business.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</strong> model asks: “How much are all those future cash prints worth
            in
            today’s money?” Because a euro today is worth more than a euro in the future, we “discount” (shrink) future
            cash
            to today’s value. Add up the discounted cash for a number of years, include a <strong>terminal
            value</strong> for
            cash beyond your forecast horizon, and you get an estimate of the company’s total worth.
        </p>

        <div class="note">Key insight: Focus on real cash generation (owner earnings) — that’s what DCF is trying to
            value.

        <h2>Owner earning</h2>
        <p class="muted">Owner earnings represent the real cash a company makes for its owners after paying all necessary expenses and maintaining its business operations. Unlike accounting profits, it shows how much money is truly available for investors — to pay dividends, reduce debt, or reinvest for growth</p>
        <div class="note">
            Owner Earnings = Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization − Capital Expenditures ± Changes in Working Capital

        <h2>How to use this calculator</h2>
        <p class="muted">We start by entering the historical figures from the company (revenue, net profit, capex, D&amp;A) easily available data. Also, we will use the 3 years
            average inorder to avoid screwed information like revenue or profit spike in one particular year.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to make a projection of Owner earning for next 5 year, then
        we discount the future value to present value using Discount rate. Our goal is to make a reasonable estimation not a precise one.</p>
        <div class="note">
           I will be using the data from www.screener.in website to get the historical data.
